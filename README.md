🚀 **Thrilled to Share a Recent Learning Milestone!** 📊

I recently completed a hands-on assignment focused on data exploration and insight extraction using **SQL queries**. It was an exciting dive into real-world scenarios where I got to manipulate structured datasets, join multiple tables, and generate actionable insights.

In this assignment, I worked with a dataset simulating an *online bookstore*. My tasks ranged from identifying the most popular books and top customers to analyzing revenue trends and calculating stock levels.

📄 I’ve attached the PDF showcasing both **the SQL database schema** and the **queries** I crafted to answer these real-world questions.

Here are just a few of the challenges I tackled:

- Which customers placed multiple orders?  
- What are the most and least stocked books?  
- What’s the total revenue from all orders?  
- Which cities have high-spending customers?  
- Who's the top-spending customer?  
- And my favorite—Which book is the most frequently ordered?
- Retrieving high-value customer and order trends
- Exploring book genres and pricing analytics
- Summarizing inventory and stock distribution
- Calculating business-critical metrics like revenue and demand

Grateful for the journey of continuous learning. If you're passionate about data, I’d love to connect and hear how you're using SQL in your projects too! 👩‍💻📈
